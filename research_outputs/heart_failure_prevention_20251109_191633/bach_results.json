      "abstract": "The \"International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for the Evaluation and Care of Cardiac Transplant Candidates-2024\" updates and replaces the \"Listing Criteria for Heart Transplantation: International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation Guidelines for the Care of Cardiac Transplant Candidates-2006\" and the \"2016 International Society for Heart Lung Transplantation Listing Criteria for Heart Transplantation: A 10-year Update.\" The document aims to provide tools to help integrate the numerous variables involved in evaluating patients for transplantation, emphasizing updating the collaborative treatment while waiting for a transplant. There have been significant practice-changing developments in the care of heart transplant recipients since the publication of the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) guidelines in 2006 and the 10-year update in 2016. The changes pertain to 3 aspects of heart transplantation: (1) patient selection criteria, (2) care of selected patient populations, and (3) durable mechanical support. To address these issues, 3 task forces were assembled. Each task force was cochaired by a pediatric heart transplant physician with the specific mandate to highlight issues unique to the pediatric heart transplant population and ensure their adequate representation. This guideline was harmonized with other ISHLT guidelines published through November 2023. The 2024 ISHLT guidelines for the evaluation and care of cardiac transplant candidates provide recommendations based on contemporary scientific evidence and patient management flow diagrams. The American College of Cardiology and American Heart Association modular knowledge chunk format has been implemented, allowing guideline information to be grouped into discrete packages (or modules) of information on a disease-specific topic or management issue. Aiming to improve the quality of care for heart transplant candidates, the recommendations present an evidence-based approach.",

      "abstract": "There is no FDA-approved left ventricular assist device (LVAD) for smaller children permitting routine hospital discharge. Smaller children supported with LVADs typically remain hospitalized for months awaiting heart transplant-a major burden for families and a challenge for hospitals. We describe the initial outcomes of the Jarvik 2015, a miniaturized implantable continuous flow LVAD, in the NHLBI-funded Pumps for Kids, Infants, and Neonates (PumpKIN) study, for bridge-to-heart transplant. Children weighing 8 to 30 kg with severe systolic heart failure and failing optimal medical therapy were recruited at 7 centers in the United States. Patients with severe right heart failure and single-ventricle congenital heart disease were excluded. The primary feasibility endpoint was survival to 30 days without severe stroke or non-operational device failure. Of 7 children implanted, the median age was 2.2 (range 0.7, 7.1) years, median weight 10 (8.2 to 20.7) kilograms; 86% had dilated cardiomyopathy; 29% were INTERMACS profile 1. The median duration of Jarvik 2015 support was 149 (range 5 to 188) days where all 7 children survived including 5 to heart transplant, 1 to recovery, and 1 to conversion to a paracorporeal device. One patient experienced an ischemic stroke on day 53 of device support in the setting of myocardial recovery. One patient required ECMO support for intractable ventricular arrhythmias and was eventually transplanted from paracorporeal biventricular VAD support. The median pump speed was 1600 RPM with power ranging from 1-4 Watts. The median plasma free hemoglobin was 19, 30, 19 and 30 mg/dL at 7, 30, 90 and 180 days or time of explant, respectively. All patients reached the primary feasibility endpoint. Patient-reported outcomes with the device were favorable with respect to participation in a full range of activities. Due to financial issues with the manufacturer, the study was suspended after consent of the eighth patient. The Jarvik 2015 LVAD appears to hold important promise as an implantable continuous flow device for smaller children that may support hospital discharge. The FDA has approved the device to proceed to a 22-subject pivotal trial. Whether this device will survive to commercialization remains unclear because of the financial challenges faced by industry seeking to develop pediatric medical devices.

      "title": "A Multi-Mode System for Myocardial Functional and Physiological Assessment during Ex Situ Heart Perfusion.",
      "abstract": "Ex situ heart perfusion (ESHP) has proven to be an important and valuable step toward better preservation of donor hearts for heart transplantation. Currently, few ESHP systems allow for a convenient functional and physiological evaluation of the heart. We sought to establish a simple system that provides functional and physiological assessment of the heart during ESHP. The ESHP circuit consists of an oxygenator, a heart-lung machine, a heater-cooler unit, an anesthesia gas blender, and a collection funnel. Female Yorkshire pig hearts (n = 10) had del Nido cardioplegia (4°C) administered, excised, and attached to the perfusion system. Hearts were perfused retrogradely into the aortic root for 2 hours before converting the system to an isovolumic mode or a working mode for further 2 hours. Blood samples were analyzed to measure metabolic parameters. During the isovolumic mode (n = 5), a balloon inserted in the left ventricular (LV) cavity was inflated so that an end-diastolic pressure of 6-8 mmHg was reached. During the working mode (n = 5), perfusion in the aortic root was redirected into left atrium (LA) using a compliance chamber which maintained an LA pressure of 6-8 mmHg. Another compliance chamber was used to provide an afterload of 40-50 mmHg. Hemodynamic and metabolic conditions remained stable and consistent for a period of 4 hours of ESHP in both isovolumic mode (LV developed pressure: 101.0 ± 3.5 vs. 99.7 ± 6.8 mmHg, <i>p</i> = .979, at 2 and 4 hours, respectively) and working mode (LV developed pressure: 91.0 ± 2.6 vs. 90.7 ± 2.5 mmHg, <i>p</i> = .942, at 2 and 4 hours, respectively). The present study proposed a novel ESHP system that enables comprehensive functional and metabolic assessment of large mammalian hearts. This system allowed for stable myocardial function for up to 4 hours of perfusion, which would offer great potential for the development of translational therapeutic protocols to improve dysfunctional donated hearts.",

      "abstract": "Although mortality has decreased considerably in pediatric heart transplantation, waitlist and post-transplant death rates remain notable. End-of-life focused research in this population, however, is very limited. This Pediatric Heart Transplant Society study aimed to describe the circumstances surrounding death of pediatric heart transplant patients. A retrospective analysis of the multi-institutional, international, Pediatric Heart Transplant Society registry was conducted. Descriptive statistics and univariate analyses were performed to 1) describe end-of-life in pediatric pre- and post-heart transplant patients and 2) examine associations between location of death and technological interventions at end-of-life with demographic and disease factors. Of 9217 patients (0-18 years) enrolled in the registry between 1993 and 2018, 2804 (30%) deaths occurred; 1310 while awaiting heart transplant and 1494 post-heart transplant. The majority of waitlist deaths (89%) occurred in the hospital, primarily in ICU (74%) with most receiving mechanical ventilation (77%). Fewer post-transplant deaths occurred in the hospital (22%). Out-of-hospital death was associated with older patient age (p < .01). ICU deaths with high use of technological interventions at end-of-life were common, particularly in patients awaiting heart transplant. In this high mortality population, findings raise challenging considerations for clinicians, families, and policy makers on how to balance quality of life amidst high risk for hospital-based death.",

      "abstract": "Despite increasing legalization and use of marijuana, there is no consensus among pediatric heart transplant institutions or providers regarding users' eligibility for cardiac transplant. We sent a survey to pediatric and ACHD transplant providers (physicians, surgeons, transplant coordinators, and pharmacists) assessing their current institution's policies and their personal opinions about marijuana use in patients being considered for heart transplantation. Of the respondents, 84% practice in the United States and Canada. Most providers (80%) care for both pediatric and ACHD patients. Respondents included cardiologists (77%) and surgeons (11%), with the remaining being coordinators and pharmacists. Most providers (73%) reported their institution had no policy regarding marijuana use in heart transplant candidates. Only 20% of respondents' institutions consider mode of consumption, with 87% and 53% approving of oral and transdermal routes, respectively, and only 7% approving of vaporized or smoked routes. While 73% of providers would consider illegal marijuana use an absolute/relative contraindication to heart transplant listing, the number decreases to 57% for legal recreational users and 21% for legal medical users. Most providers personally believe marijuana to be physically and mentally/emotionally harmful to pediatric patients (67% and 72%, respectively). Many institutions lack a policy regarding marijuana use in pediatric and ACHD heart transplant candidates, and there is considerable disagreement among providers on the best practice. With increasing legalization and use of marijuana, each institution will have to address this issue thoughtfully to continue to provide high-quality, consistent, and equitable care for pediatric and ACHD heart transplant candidates.",

      "abstract": "The number of heart transplants in adults with congenital heart disease (CHD) is increasing, though outcomes remain unfavorable compared to those without CHD. The etiology of this mortality difference remains uncertain. Panel reactive antibody (PRA) is a predictor of survival post-transplantation, and adult CHD patients have been observed to have higher PRA levels. Here we assessed the relationship between PRA and outcomes in adult patients with CHD who underwent heart transplantation. This is a retrospective cohort study using the 2004-2015 ISHLT Thoracic Organ Transplant Registry to investigate the role of sensitization in the observed excess mortality. The composite outcome of mortality or graft failure within 1-year of transplantation was compared among CHD vs. non-CHD recipients, according to sensitization as measured by pre-transplant panel reactive antibodies (PRA). Adults with CHD (n = 1188) had higher PRA level compared to non-CHD (n = 38,201) recipients (27% vs. 18% PRA>10%, respectively, p < 0.001). CHD diagnosis remained independently associated with a higher incidence of the composite outcome in multivariable analysis after adjusting for PRA and other variables. Further, even after age-matching, patients with CHD and PRA ≤10% were at higher risk of the primary outcome compared to non-CHD (OR 2.1 [1.4-3.4], p = 0.001), though both groups had comparable outcomes when PRA was >10% (OR 1.1 [0.6-2.0], p = 0.852). Adults with CHD are more likely to have higher sensitization and worse outcomes than non-CHD recipients. Higher sensitization rates alone do not fully explain their excess risk of adverse outcomes after heart transplantation.",

In the past 20 years, the field of heart regeneration has entered a renaissance period with remarkable progress in the understanding of endogenous heart regeneration, stem cell differentiation for exogenous cell therapy, and cell-delivery methods. In this review, we highlight how this new understanding can lead to viable strategies for human therapy. For the near term, drugs, electrical and mechanical devices, and heart transplantation will remain mainstays of cardiac therapies, but eventually regenerative therapies based on fundamental regenerative biology may offer more permanent solutions for patients with heart failure.",

      "abstract": "We evaluated the impact of pediatric heart-allocation policy changes over time and the approval of the Berlin ventricular assist device (VAD) on waitlist (WL) outcomes for children with congenital heart disease (CHD). The Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipients database was evaluated to include all children (age < 18) with CHD and cardiomyopathy (CMP) on the WL between 1999 and 2019, divided into 4 eras: Era 1 (1999-2008); Era 2 (2009-2011); Era 3 (2012-2016); and Era 4 (2016-2019). WL characteristics and survival outcomes were evaluated for patients with CHD over time and were compared to those with CMP listed currently (Era 4). We included 5185 children with CHD on the WL during the study period; 1999 (39%) were listed in Era 1; 693 (13%) in Era 2; 1196 (23%) in Era 3; and 1297 (25%) in Era 4. Compared to the CHD WL in eras 1 and 2, those in Era 4 were less likely to be infants (48% vs 49% vs 43%), on mechanical ventilation (30% vs 26% vs 19%), on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (15% vs 9.7% vs 6.2%), and were more likely to be on a VAD (2.4% vs 2.2% vs 6.0%) (P < .05 for all). WL survival improved in children with CHD from Era 1 to Era 4 (P < .001). However, in Era 4, children with CHD had lower WL survival than those with CMP (P < .001). Children with CHD are increasingly being listed with less advanced heart failure, and they have had improved WL survival over time; however, WL outcomes remain inferior to those with CMP. Advances in pediatric medical and VAD therapy may improve future WL outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Evidence for the efficacy of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) in pediatric and congenital heart disease (CHD) has been limited to surrogate outcomes. This study aimed to assess the impact of CRT upon the risk of transplantation or death in a retrospective, high-risk, controlled cohort at 5 quaternary referral centers. Both CRT patients and control patients were <21 years of age or had CHD; had systemic ventricular ejection fraction <45%; symptomatic heart failure; and significant electrical dyssynchrony (QRS duration z score >3 or single-site ventricular pacing >40%) at enrollment. Patients with CRT were matched with control patients via 1:1 propensity score matching. CRT patients were enrolled at CRT implantation; control patients were enrolled at the outpatient clinical encounter where inclusion criteria were first met. The primary endpoint was transplantation or death. In total, 324 control patients and 167 CRT recipients were identified. Mean follow-up was 4.2 ± 3.7 years. Upon propensity score matching, 139 closely matched pairs were identified (20 baseline indices). Of the 139 matched pairs, 52 (37.0%) control patients and 31 (22.0%) CRT recipients reached the primary endpoint. On both unadjusted and multivariable Cox regression analysis, the risk reduction associated with CRT for the primary endpoint was significant (HR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.25-0.64; P < 0.001; and HR: 0.44; 95% CI: 0.28-0.71; P = 0.001, respectively). On longitudinal assessment, the CRT group had significantly improved systemic ventricular ejection fraction (P < 0.001) and shorter QRS duration (P = 0.015), sustained to 5 years. In pediatric and CHD patients with symptomatic systolic heart failure and electrical dyssynchrony, CRT was associated with improved heart transplantation-free survival.",

      "abstract": "Left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) is independently associated with cardiovascular events in patients with congenital heart disease. Although artificial intelligence-enhanced electrocardiogram (AI-ECG) analysis is predictive of LVSD in the general adult population, it has yet to be applied comprehensively across congenital heart disease lesions. We trained a convolutional neural network on paired ECG-echocardiograms (≤2 days apart) across the lifespan of a wide range of congenital heart disease lesions to detect left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 40% or less. Model performance was evaluated on single ECG-echocardiogram pairs per patient at Boston Children's Hospital (Boston, MA, USA) and externally at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (Philadelphia, PA, USA) using area under the receiver operating (AUROC) and precision-recall (AUPRC) curves. The training cohort comprised 124 265 ECG-echocardiogram pairs (49 158 patients; median age 10·5 years [IQR 3·5-16·8]; 3381 [2·7%] of 124 265 ECG-echocardiogram pairs with LVEF ≤40%). Test groups included internal testing (21 068 patients; median age 10·9 years [IQR 3·7-17·0]; 3381 [2·7%] of 124 265 ECG-echocardiogram pairs with LVEF ≤40%) and external validation (42 984 patients; median age 10·8 years [IQR 4·9-15·0]; 1313 [1·7%] of 76 400 ECG-echocardiogram pairs with LVEF ≤40%) cohorts. High model performance was achieved during internal testing (AUROC 0·95, AUPRC 0·33) and external validation (AUROC 0·96, AUPRC 0·25) for a wide range of congenital heart disease lesions. Patients with LVEF greater than 40% by echocardiogram who were deemed high risk by AI-ECG were more likely to have future dysfunction compared with low-risk patients (hazard ratio 12·1 [95% CI 8·4-17·3]; p<0·0001). High-risk patients by AI-ECG were at increased risk of mortality in the overall cohort and lesion-specific subgroups. Common salient features highlighted across congenital heart disaese lesions include precordial QRS complexes and T waves, with common high-risk ECG features including deep V2 S waves and lateral precordial T wave inversion. A case study on patients with ventricular pacing showed similar findings. Our externally validated algorithm shows promise in prediction of current and future LVSD in patients with congenital heart disease, providing a clinically impactful, inexpensive, and convenient cardiovascular health tool in this population.
