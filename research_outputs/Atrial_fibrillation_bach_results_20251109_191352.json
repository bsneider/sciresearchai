      "title": "Impact of Cerebral Microbleeds in Stroke Patients with Atrial Fibrillation.",
      "abstract": "Cerebral microbleeds are associated with the risks of ischemic stroke and intracranial hemorrhage, causing clinical dilemmas for antithrombotic treatment decisions. We aimed to evaluate the risks of intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke associated with microbleeds in patients with atrial fibrillation treated with vitamin K antagonists, direct oral anticoagulants, antiplatelets, and combination therapy (i.e. concurrent oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet). We included patients with documented atrial fibrillation from the pooled individual patient data analysis by the Microbleeds International Collaborative Network. Risks of subsequent intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke were compared between patients with and without microbleeds, stratified by antithrombotic use. A total of 7,839 patients were included. The presence of microbleeds was associated with an increased relative risk of intracranial hemorrhage (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] = 2.74, 95% confidence interval = 1.76-4.26) and ischemic stroke (aHR = 1.29, 95% confidence interval = 1.04-1.59). For the entire cohort, the absolute incidence of ischemic stroke was higher than intracranial hemorrhage regardless of microbleed burden. However, for the subgroup of patients taking combination of anticoagulant and antiplatelet therapy, the absolute risk of intracranial hemorrhage exceeded that of ischemic stroke in those with 2 to 4 microbleeds (25 vs 12 per 1,000 patient-years) and ≥ 11 microbleeds (94 vs 48 per 1,000 patient-years). Patients with atrial fibrillation and high burden of microbleeds receiving combination therapy have a tendency of higher rate of intracranial hemorrhage than ischemic stroke, with potential for net harm. Further studies are needed to help optimize stroke preventive strategies in this high-risk group. ANN NEUROL 2023;94:61-74.",

      "abstract": "Guidelines recommend trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) for patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial flutter (AFL) for >48 h, due to risk of intracardiac thrombus formation. With growing evidence that AFL in adults with structurally normal hearts has less thrombogenic potential compared to AF, and the need for TEE questioned, we compared prevalence of intracardiac thrombus detected by TEE in pediatric and congenital heart disease (CHD) patients presenting in AF and AFL. Single-center, cross-sectional analysis for unique first-time presentations of patients for either AF, AFL, or intra-atrial reentrant tachycardia (IART) between 2000 and 2019. Patients were categorized by presenting arrhythmia (AF vs. AFL/IART), with the exclusion of other forms of atrial tachycardia, hemodynamic instability, chronic anti-coagulation before TEE, and presentation for a reason other than TEE examination for thrombus. A total of 201 patients had TEE with co-diagnosis of AF or AFL. Of these, 105 patients (29 AF, 76 AFL) met inclusion criteria, with no difference in age between AF (median 24.9 years; IQR 18.6-38.3 years) and AFL/IART (23.3 years; 15.4-38.4 years). The prevalence of thrombus in the entire cohort was 9.5%, with no difference between AF (13.8%) and AFL groups (7.9%), p = .46. Patients with thrombus demonstrated no difference in age, systemic ventricular function, cardiac complexity, or CHADS2/CHA2DS2VASc score at presentation. The risk for intracardiac thrombus is high in the pediatric and CHD population, with no apparent distinguishing factors to warrant a change in the recommendations for TEE, with all levels of cardiac complexity being at risk for clot.",

A Clinical Consensus Statement of the Association of Cardiovascular Nursing and Allied Professions (ACNAP) and the European Heart Rhythm Association (EHRA) of the ESC.",
      "abstract": "The complexity of atrial fibrillation (AF) requires an integrated, multifaceted, multidisciplinary, and holistic team approach to optimize the management of AF patients. Active engagement of patients and involvement of nurses and various allied professionals (AP) and a strong collaboration with physicians is crucial in this respect as indicated by the 2024 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines on the management of AF. This is also reflected in these latest guidelines by the concept of AF-CARE, which emphasizes the importance of including the patient, carers, and various healthcare professionals. In this Clinical Consensus Statement, the role of nurses and APs is highlighted and includes optimal approaches on their involvement in the implementation and execution for these guideline recommendations in daily clinical practice. Moreover, additional detail will be provided to the key components and their requirements to allow this integrated multidisciplinary care to be implemented alongside the perspective of the patient. This Statement also examines the challenges and opportunities in relation to their application to clinical practice and how optimal multidisciplinary care can be implemented.",

      "title": "Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy and Ventricular Preexcitation in the Young: Cause and Accessory Pathway Characteristics.",
      "abstract": "The cause of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in the young is highly varied. Ventricular preexcitation (preexcitation) is well recognized, yet little is known about the specificity for any cause and the characteristics of the responsible accessory pathways (AP). Retrospective cohort study of patients <21 years of age with HCM/preexcitation from 2000 to 2022. The cause of HCM was defined as isolated HCM, storage disorder, metabolic disease, or genetic syndrome. Atrioventricular AP (true AP) were distinguished from fasciculoventricular fibers (FVF) using standard invasive electrophysiology study criteria. AP were defined as high risk if any of the following were <250 ms: shortest preexcited RR interval in atrial fibrillation, shortest paced preexcited cycle length, or anterograde AP effective refractory period. We identified 345 patients with HCM and 28 (8%) had preexcitation (isolated HCM, 10/220; storage disorder, 8/17; metabolic disease, 5/19; and genetic syndrome, 5/89). Six (21%) patients had clinical atrial fibrillation (1 with shortest preexcited RR interval <250 ms). Twenty-two patients underwent electrophysiology study which identified 23 true AP and 16 FVF. Preexcitation was exclusively FVF mediated in 8 (36%) patients. Five (23%) patients had AP with high-risk conduction properties (including ≥1 patient in each etiologic group). Multiple AP were seen in 8 (36%) and AP plus FVF in 10 (45%) patients. Ablation was acutely successful in 13 of 14 patients with recurrence in 3. One procedure was complicated by complete heart block after ablation of a high-risk midseptal AP. There were significant differences in QRS amplitude and delta wave amplitude between groups. There were no surface ECG features that differentiated AP from FVF. Young patients with HCM and preexcitation have a high likelihood of underlying storage disease or metabolic disease. Nonisolated HCM should be suspected in young patients with large QRS and delta wave amplitudes. Surface ECG is not adequate to discriminate preexcitation from a benign FVF from that secondary to potentially life-threatening AP.",

      "title": "Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio: link to congestion, inflammation, and mortality in outpatients with heart failure.",
      "abstract": "The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) may be a useful marker of inflammation, but its associations with clinical characteristics, signs of congestion and outcome in patients with chronic heart failure (HF) are unknown. We enrolled 4702 ambulatory patients with HF and either left ventricular systolic dysfunction or high N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) (≥125 ng/L). Compared with those in the lowest quartile of NLR (≤2.05), patients in the highest quartile (≥4.10) were older, had higher NTproBNP, and were more likely to have HF with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (HFrEF), atrial fibrillation and to be treated with loop diuretics. In 813 patients with detailed echocardiographic assessment, lymphocyte count correlated inversely with NTproBNP (r = -0.31) and markers of congestion [left atrial volume index (r = -0.25), inferior vena cava diameter (r = -0.24)]; neutrophil count correlated positively with high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) (r = 0.31, P < 0.001). During a median follow-up of 54 (29-100) months, 3015 (64%) patients died. In models adjusted for NTproBNP and HsCRP, higher NLR [hazard ratio (HR):1.05; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-1.06] and neutrophil count (HR:1.07; 95%CI 1.04-1.10) were associated with higher mortality rates; higher lymphocyte count (HR:0.88; 95%CI 0.82-0.95) was associated with lower risk (all P < 0.001). Low lymphocyte count is associated with more congestion and high neutrophil count with more inflammation, which may explain why a greater NLR is associated with a poorer prognosis. For patients with heart failure, NLR or its components could be useful for risk stratification or for monitoring evolving risk, but might also be therapeutic targets.",

      "title": "Salt-Sensitive Ileal Microbiota Plays a Role in Atrial Natriuretic Peptide Deficiency-Induced Cardiac Injury.",
      "abstract": "Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) activity deficiency contributes to salt-sensitive hypertension in humans and mice. However, the role of ileal microbiota in salt sensitivity in ANP deficiency-related cardiac injury has not been investigated yet. This study used ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice to analyze the role of the salt-sensitive ileal microbiome on cardiac injury. ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice showed an increase in blood pressure (BP), the heart weight/body weight (HW/BW) ratio, and cardiac hypertrophy compared with wild-type (WT) mice. ANP deficiency did not impact the histological structure but reduced occludin expression in the ileum. Antibiotics significantly relieved BP and cardiac hypertrophy in ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. A high-salt diet (HSD) increased BP, the HW/BW ratio, and cardiac hypertrophy/fibrosis in WT and ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice, and an HSD treatment in ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice exacerbated these cardiac parameters. The HSD markedly decreased muscularis layer thickening, villus length, and numbers of Paneth and goblet cells in the ileum of WT and ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Furthermore, the HSD increased the level of TLR4 and IL-1β in ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice ileum compared with WT mice. Antibiotics reduced the HW/BW ratio, cardiac hypertrophy/fibrosis, and the level of TLR4 and IL-1β in the ileum, and rescued the muscularis layer thickening, villus length, and numbers of Paneth and goblet cells in the ileum of HSD-ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Importantly, ANP deficiency induced the colonization of <i>Burkholderiales bacterium YL45</i>, <i>Lactobacillus johnsonii</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> in the ileum on the NSD diet, which was only observed in HSD-induced WT mice but not in WT mice on the NSD. Besides, the HSD significantly enhanced the sum of the percentage of the colonization of <i>Burkholderiales bacterium YL45</i>, <i>Lactobacillus johnsonii</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> in the ileum of ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice. Ileal microbiota transfer (IMT) from ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice to healthy C57BL/6J mice drove <i>Lactobacillus johnsonii</i> and <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> colonization in the ileum, which manifested an increase in BP, the HW/BW ratio, cardiac hypertrophy, and ileal pathology compared with IMT from WT mice. The HSD in C57BL/6J mice with IMT from ANP<sup>-/-</sup> mice drove the colonization of <i>Burkholderiales bacterium YL45</i>, <i>Lactobacillus johnsonii</i>, and <i>Lactobacillus reuteri</i> in the ileum and further exacerbated the cardiac and ileal pathology. Our results suggest that salt-sensitive ileal microbiota is probably related to ANP deficiency-induced cardiac injury.",

      "title": "The Burden of Radiation Exposure During Transcatheter Closure of Atrial Septal Defect.",
      "abstract": "Radiation reduction in the pediatric cardiac catheterization laboratory is well-suited for targeted quality improvement (QI) interventions. Transcatheter atrial septal defect (ASD) closure was chosen for this QI project based on a homogenous procedural population and inter-operator variability in radiation usage, with the aim to reduce radiation exposure during ASD device closure by 50% over 1 year. The aim for this project was defined and a Key Driver Diagram (KDD) was created with three domains for change: modification of procedural practice, reporting and monitoring/feedback, and team engagement. All patients undergoing attempted transcatheter ASD closure were considered for inclusion. The primary outcome, % reduction in median radiation dose (DAP/Kg), was determined through comparison with a historical cohort. Additional radiation metrics, procedural characteristics, and adverse events (AE) were compared to the historical cohort. Radiation exposure (DAP/kg) was reduced by 55% with a median dose reduction from 26 (15, 61) in a historical cohort to 12 (6, 22) in the intervention population (p <0.001). Fluoroscopy time and cine acquisition utilization significantly decreased. Procedure time, procedural success (defined as successful delivery of the device) and AE did not increase in the QI cohort. Successful practice changes included standardized procedural strategies to limit fluoroscopy and cine acquisition, improved fluoroscopic practice, engagement of the multidisciplinary team, and feedback with data reporting by electronic and in-person reminders. In conclusion, application of QI methodologies such as KDD with engagement of a multidisciplinary team can effectively reduce radiation in the pediatric catheterization laboratory.",

      "abstract": "Truncating variants in the desmosomal gene <i>PKP2 (PKP2</i>tv) cause arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) yet display varied penetrance and expressivity. We identified individuals with <i>PKP2</i>tv from the UK Biobank (UKB) and determined the prevalence of an ARVC phenotype and other cardiovascular traits based on clinical and procedural data. The <i>PKP2</i>tv minor allelic frequency in the UKB was compared with a second cohort of probands with a clinical diagnosis of ARVC (ARVC cohort), with a figure of 1:5000 assumed for disease prevalence. In silico predictors of variant pathogenicity (combined annotation-dependent depletion and Splice AI [Illumina, Inc.]) were assessed. <i>PKP2</i>tv were identified in 193/200 643 (0.10%) UKB participants, with 47 unique <i>PKP2</i>tv. Features consistent with ARVC were present in 3 (1.6%), leaving 190 with <i>PKP2</i>tv without manifest disease (UKB cohort; minor allelic frequency 4.73×10<sup>-4</sup>). The ARVC cohort included 487 ARVC probands with 144 distinct <i>PKP2</i>tv, with 25 <i>PKP2</i>tv common to both cohorts. The odds ratio for ARVC for the 25 common <i>PKP2</i>tv was 0.047 (95% CI, 0.001-0.268; <i>P=</i>2.43×10<sup>-6</sup>), and only favored ARVC (odds ratio >1) for a single variant, p.Arg79*. In silico variant analysis did not differentiate <i>PKP2</i>tv between the 2 cohorts. Atrial fibrillation was over-represented in the UKB cohort in those with <i>PKP2</i>tv (7.9% versus 4.3%; odds ratio, 2.11; <i>P</i>=0.005). <i>PKP2</i>tv are prevalent in the population and associated with ARVC in only a small minority, necessitating a more detailed understanding of how <i>PKP2</i>tv cause ARVC in combination with associated genetic and environmental risk factors.",

      "abstract": "Andexanet alfa is a modified recombinant inactive factor Xa (FXa) designed to reverse FXa inhibitors. ANNEXA-4 (Andexanet Alfa, a Novel Antidote to the Anticoagulation Effects of Factor Xa Inhibitors) was a multicenter, prospective, phase-3b/4, single-group cohort study that evaluated andexanet alfa in patients with acute major bleeding. The results of the final analyses are presented. Patients with acute major bleeding within 18 hours of FXa inhibitor administration were enrolled. Co-primary end points were anti-FXa activity change from baseline during andexanet alfa treatment and excellent or good hemostatic efficacy, defined by a scale used in previous reversal studies, at 12 hours. The efficacy population included patients with baseline anti-FXa activity levels above predefined thresholds (≥75 ng/mL for apixaban and rivaroxaban, ≥40 ng/mL for edoxaban, and ≥0.25 IU/mL for enoxaparin; reported in the same units used for calibrators) who were adjudicated as meeting major bleeding criteria (modified International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis definition). The safety population included all patients. Major bleeding criteria, hemostatic efficacy, thrombotic events (stratified by occurring before or after restart of either prophylactic [ie, a lower dose, for prevention rather than treatment] or full-dose oral anticoagulation), and deaths were assessed by an independent adjudication committee. Median endogenous thrombin potential at baseline and across the follow-up period was a secondary outcome. There were 479 patients enrolled (mean age, 78 years; 54% male; 86% White); 81% were anticoagulated for atrial fibrillation, and the median time was 11.4 hours since last dose, with 245 (51%) on apixaban, 176 (37%) on rivaroxaban, 36 (8%) on edoxaban, and 22 (5%) on enoxaparin. Bleeding was predominantly intracranial (n=331 [69%]) or gastrointestinal (n=109 [23%]). In evaluable apixaban patients (n=172), median anti-FXa activity decreased from 146.9 ng/mL to 10.0 ng/mL (reduction, 93% [95% CI, 94-93]); in rivaroxaban patients (n=132), it decreased from 214.6 ng/mL to 10.8 ng/mL (94% [95% CI, 95-93]); in edoxaban patients (n=28), it decreased from 121.1 ng/mL to 24.4 ng/mL (71% [95% CI, 82-65); and in enoxaparin patients (n=17), it decreased from 0.48 IU/mL to 0.11 IU/mL (75% [95% CI, 79-67]). Excellent or good hemostasis occurred in 274 of 342 evaluable patients (80% [95% CI, 75-84]). In the safety population, thrombotic events occurred in 50 (10%) patients; in 16 patients, these occurred during treatment with prophylactic anticoagulation that began after the bleeding event. No thrombotic episodes occurred after oral anticoagulation restart. Specific to certain populations, reduction of anti-FXa activity from baseline to nadir significantly predicted hemostatic efficacy in patients with intracranial hemorrhage (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.54-0.70]) and correlated with lower mortality in patients <75 years of age (adjusted <i>P</i>=0.022; unadjusted <i>P</i>=0.003). Median endogenous thrombin potential was within the normal range by the end of andexanet alfa bolus through 24 hours for all FXa inhibitors. In patients with major bleeding associated with the use of FXa inhibitors, treatment with andexanet alfa reduced anti-FXa activity and was associated with good or excellent hemostatic efficacy in 80% of patients.

      "title": "Comparing apples to apples: Exploring public reporting of congenital cardiac surgery outcomes based on common congenital heart operations.",
      "abstract": "We sought to simplify reporting of outcomes in congenital heart surgery that compares well-defined patient groups and accommodates multiple stakeholder needs while being easily understandable. We selected 19 commonly performed congenital heart surgeries ranging in complexity from repair of atrial septal defects to the Norwood procedure. Strict inclusion/exclusion criteria ensured the creation of 19 well-defined diagnosis/procedure cohorts. Preoperative, procedural, and postoperative data were collected for consecutive eligible patients from 9 centers between January 1, 2016, and December 31, 2021. Unadjusted operative mortality rates and hospital length of stay for each of the 19 diagnosis/procedure cohorts were summarized in aggregate and stratified by each center. Of 8572 eligible cases included, numbers in the 19 diagnosis/procedure cohorts ranged from 73 for tetralogy of Fallot repair after previous palliation to 1224 for ventricular septal defect (VSD) repair for isolated VSD. In aggregate, the unadjusted mortality ranged from 0% for atrial septal defect repair to 28.4% for hybrid stage I. There was significant heterogeneity in case mix and mortality for different diagnosis/procedure cohorts across centers (eg, arterial switch operation/VSD, n = 7-42, mortality 0%-7.4%; Norwood procedure, n = 16-122, mortality 5.3%-25%). Reporting of institutional case volumes and outcomes within well-defined diagnosis/procedure cohorts can enable centers to benchmark outcomes, understand trends in mortality, and direct quality improvement. When made public, this type of report could provide parents with information on institutional volumes and outcomes and allow them to better understand the experience of each program with operations for specific congenital heart defects.",
