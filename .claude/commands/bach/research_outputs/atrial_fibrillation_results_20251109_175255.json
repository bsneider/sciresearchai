Additional relevant studies, published through November 2022, during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables, where appropriate.\n\n\nSTRUCTURE\nAtrial fibrillation is the most sustained common arrhythmia, and its incidence and prevalence are increasing in the United States and globally. Recommendations from the \"2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation\" and the \"2019 AHA/ACC/HRS Focused Update of the 2014 AHA/ACC/HRS Guideline for the Management of Patients With Atrial Fibrillation\" have been updated with new evidence to guide clinicians. In addition, new recommendations addressing atrial fibrillation and thromboembolic risk assessment, anticoagulation, left atrial appendage occlusion, atrial fibrillation catheter or surgical ablation, and risk factor modification and atrial fibrillation prevention have been developed.",

      "abstract": "Atrial Fibrillation is a common form of irregular heart rhythm that can be\nvery dangerous. Our primary goal is to analyze Atrial Fibrillation data within\nECGs to develop a model based only on RR-Intervals, or the length between\nheart-beats, to create a real time classification model for Atrial Fibrillation\nto be implemented in common heart-rate monitors on the market today.\nPhysionet's MIT-BIH Atrial Fibrillation Database\n\\cite{goldberger2000physiobank} and 2017 Challenge Database\n\\cite{clifford2017af} were used to identify patterns of Atrial Fibrillation and\ntest classification models on. These two datasets are very different. The\nMIT-BIH database contains long samples taken with a medical grade device, which\nis not useful for simulating a consumer device, but is useful for Atrial\nFibrillation pattern detection. The 2017 Challenge database includes short\n($&lt;60sec$) samples taken with a portable device and reveals many of the\nchallenges of Atrial Fibrillation classification in a real-time device. We\ndeveloped multiple SVM models with three sets of extracted features as\npredictor variables which gave us moderately high accuracies with low\ncomputational intensity. With robust filtering techniques already applied in\nmany Photoplethysmograph-based consumer heart-rate monitors, this method can be\nused to develop a reliable real time model for Atrial Fibrillation detection in\nconsumer-grade heart-rate monitors.",
